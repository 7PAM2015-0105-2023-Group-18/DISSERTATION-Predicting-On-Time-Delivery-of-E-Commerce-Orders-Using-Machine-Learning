# Predicting On-Time Delivery of E-Commerce Orders Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting on-time delivery of e-commerce orders. The project focuses on identifying key characteristics of orders and customers that influence delivery times and developing various machine learning models to predict these outcomes accurately.

### Research Questions:
1. What characteristics of orders and customers influence the likelihood of on-time delivery of e-commerce orders?
2. Which machine learning model can most accurately predict the on-time delivery of e-commerce orders?

### Objectives:
- Identify key characteristics impacting on-time delivery.
- Develop and compare various machine learning models.
- Optimize prediction accuracy through feature engineering and model tuning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "E-Commerce Shipping Data" available on Kaggle, collected by Prachi A. It contains data about order delivery times, modes, and other relevant attributes. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics).

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for the project including data preprocessing, model development, and utilities.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project including project reports and references.
